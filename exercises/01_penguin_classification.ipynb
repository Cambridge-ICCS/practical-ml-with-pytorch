    "\n",
    "####  Choosing an Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we write our training and evaluation loops, we need to choose an **activation function** to apply to the model's outputs. This step ensures the outputs can be meaningfully compared to our targets — e.g. `[0, 0, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: We are **not** including the activation function inside the network architecture itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **softmax** activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PyTorch documentation on `nn.Softmax`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Softmax.html)\n",
    "- It is appropriate when the result should be **one of**: `A or B or C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Why softmax? And what’s this about thermodynamics?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax is a generalization of the sigmoid function for **multi-class classification** problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve studied physics, it might remind you of the **partition function** in thermodynamics — softmax turns logits into a normalised probability distribution, just as a partition function normalises energy states.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activation is **not appropriate** if you want to assign **multiple labels** to the same input (e.g. both \"dog\" _and_ \"cat\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax converts raw model outputs (logits) into **pseudo-probabilities**.  \n",

    "- Use `preds.argmax(dim=1)` to get the predicted class per example.\n",
