    "- Why use BCELoss?\n",
    "  - It may seem odd to be using BCELoss for a multi-class classification problem. In this case, BCELoss treats each element of the prediction vector as an independent binary classification problem. For each class, it compares the predicted probability against the target and computes the loss. It might be better to use `CrossEntropyLoss` instead (ground truth does not need to be one-hot encoded). `CrossEntropyLoss` combines softmax and negative log likelihood. \n"
